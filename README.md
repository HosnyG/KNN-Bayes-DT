# KNN-Bayes-DT# KNN , Decision Tree, Naive Bayes without using any Libraries
<br>
in this project we will implement KNN, DT and Naive Bayes with python without using external machine learning libraries
in particular : pandas, numpy and sklearn . <br>
in addition , we will implement K-FOLD CROSS VALIDATION to estimate the accuracy for these classification algorithms.
